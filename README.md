##Checklist##
-----------------------------
This checklist includes basic rules to keep in mind about HTML, CSS ,file management, content, design, saving images, accessibility, and code validation.

It's a great way to review everything what I've learned so far, and I will keep adding more and more basic rules for web design while I am learning new stuff. 

Making the checklist was also a great way to practise all these rules.
